By downloading, accessing, or using PromptVault, **you agree to these Terms** and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the app. Continued use constitutes acceptance of any updated Terms that take effect after notice.

## 2) The service
PromptVault is a free, closed-source Android app to create, save, and manage prompts, operating online (with Firebase) and offline (local cache). We currently have **no ads**, but **we may introduce ads or other monetization later**; any material changes will be announced and these Terms/Privacy Policy will be updated.

## 3) Accounts & eligibility
- You must use **Google Sign-In** to access cloud features.  
- You’re responsible for keeping access to your Google account secure.  
- **Anonymous accounts** (if allowed) are not guaranteed to persist and **may be deleted at any time** due to strict resource limits.

We grant you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use PromptVault solely for its intended purpose. We retain all rights in the app and its code; it is **closed source**.

## 5) Your content
- You retain rights to the prompts and collections you create.  
- You grant us a limited license to store, process, and display your content solely to operate the app.

You agree not to:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the app’s source code (except where the law permits despite these restrictions).

We may remove content or restrict access that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or threatens the service.

## 7) Availability; changes; discontinuation
- The service may change, be limited, or become unavailable from time to time.  
- We may **pause or discontinue** the online service. **Before doing so, we will show an in-app notice and provide time/instructions to back up your data** so you can continue with an offline version.  
- We may set or adjust technical limits (e.g., storage, rate limits), especially for anonymous accounts.

## 9) Updates
We may push updates or require you to install updates to continue using the app. Some features may not function on outdated versions.

## 10) Third-party services
The app relies on **Google Firebase** (Auth, Firestore, Crashlytics). Your use of the app also constitutes your agreement to their applicable terms and policies as necessary to provide the service.

## 11) Disclaimers
PromptVault is provided **“as is” and “as available.”** To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties (express or implied), including fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and availability.

## 12) Limitation of liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we (and our affiliates) will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages; loss of data, profits, or goodwill; or service interruptions.

## 13) Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your use of the app or your content, except to the extent caused by our willful misconduct.

## 14) Termination
You may stop using the app at any time. We may suspend or terminate access (including deleting anonymous accounts) if you violate these Terms or if operating the service becomes impractical. On termination, your license ends and you must stop using the app. Data handling will follow the Privacy Policy.

## 15) Governing law & venue
These Terms are governed by the **laws of India**, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in **Uttar Pradesh, India** (or another venue we mutually agree in writing).
